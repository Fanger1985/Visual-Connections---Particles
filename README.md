# Connect 2.0

eperiment in finding connections.
The goal of this was to create a way to visually see connections between ... whatever...  (initially i made it as a way to see which tools and assets i could use between different projects but the possibilities are endless)

Goals:
- Better filtering of tags
- Search feature (plus would be if searching grouped appropriate particles together as a filter method)
- Better save/load system
- responsive to phones and small screens improvement
- color coding for tag connections 


- back end support
